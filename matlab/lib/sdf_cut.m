function [sdf_block, sdf_out] = sdf_cut(sdf_in, blockname)
% SDF_CUT Cut block from struct data file.
%   [SDF_BLOCK SDF_OUT] = SDF_CUT(SDF_IN, BLOCKNAME) cuts a block from a struct
%   data file.
%
%   Inputs:
%   SDF_IN      cell array of struct data file lines
%   BLOCKNAME   name of block to cut out
%
%   Outputs:
%   SDF_BLOCK   cell array of struct data lines of named block
%   SDF_OUT     cell array of remaining struct data lines
%
%   Example:
%   [sdf_block, sdf_out] = sdf_cut(sdf_in, blockname) extracts a SDF block.
%
%   See also SDF_ADD.
